## Eduardo Gimenez
üåê In terms of web development I am a fullstack developer and I can work both on the backend and on the frontend but preferably I work more on the backend developing APIs with Express and other frameworks at my disposal.

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª In terms of software development, I have experience with C, C# and Python and I can develop from graphical interfaces using frameworks or developing my own, as well as developing the necessary subsystems for the operation of a software.

üïπÔ∏è In terms of game development, I have experience with the development of auxiliary systems that complement the game, such as dialogue systems, translation systems, life systems, fishing, among many others.

### Languages
<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" alt="HTML 5"></img> HTML5 is indeed indispensable in the field of web development. A very simple and practical markup language based on XML.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" alt="CSS 3"></img> CSS 3 is essential for theming our pages, but of course there's nothing better than frameworks like SCSS to improve our experience.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg" alt="JavaScript"></img> After dealing with PHP, my focus was on learning JavaScript. One of the most used languages in the context of web development, so much so that I still use it with other frameworks to enrich the user experience.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python"></img> My first experience with python I started working with servers for games, in fact I learned a lot with python and I still use it sometimes but not for servers but for data science and apis.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" alt="CSharp"></img> I learned C# recently and I'm still learning because I'm participating in the development of a game. Thank you [Wizardry Team](https://github.com/TeamWizardry) for this opportunity :heart:

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/c/c-original.svg" alt="C"></img> I learned C so I could develop libraries for the Lua language and it was a strange but fun experience.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/lua/lua-original.svg" alt="Lua"></img> Lua was one of the first languages I learned when I started developing minigames for games where I developed a huge interest in the language itself.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/php/php-original.svg" alt="PHP"></img> PHP was my first touch with web development, where I created my first login system with a mysql database. Despite its evolution in recent times, I no longer have any interest in it.

  <summary>Softwares and frameworks</summary>
<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/godot/godot-original.svg" alt="Godot"></img> I'm currently developing a game in Godot together with the Wizardry team. It's a fun yet complicated experience.


<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="Visual Studio Code"></img> VSCode is my main editor at the moment, I use it in daily development.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original.svg" alt="React"></img> React was actually the first framework I ever used in JavaScript and I really enjoy using it. And yes, I've lived through the days of BootStrap or JQuery but I was never interested in any of them.

<img height="20" width="30" src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/express/express-original.svg" alt="Express"></img> After learning React I had a huge interest in developing APIs with Express. I can say that it is very useful and it contains a huge base of plugins.

``There is a long list of software/frameworks, but these are the main ones at the moment.``

### A little about myself
I am a 20 year old Brazilian young man who aims to become a software engineer. I've always had a huge interest in programming because it's always fascinated me since I was a kid, you could even say that I was obsessed with learning but in fact programming causes me enormous comfort and pleasure. I love animals too, nature has always had a place in my heart as it is such a nurturing place. And as much as many may doubt I'm a homebody, I like comfort and I'm not one to socialize however I work very well in a team, I'm a great listener and I'm always ready to give my opinion on whatever is necessary.

Some also know me as a Mediator, I'm usually that neutral side that calms everyone's spirits during a confrontation, I have this calming effect where I try to smooth things back into a conversation where we can reach a mutual agreement.
